## System requirements

* UNIX shell (bash): for running the principal scripts (.sh) created for convenience
* Make (GNU make): for using the workflow configuration provided (workflow.cfg)
* Java 8: for executing core processing using the provided EhuBio.jar file
* Python 3: for executing optional fasta database utilities

## Fasta dababase

Separated target and decoy database searches are required by this software. The target-decoy competition is carried out *a posteriori* by the software itself.

Protein accessions and gene names are required to be present in the target fasta file headers. UniProt headers format is recommended for that.

Decoy headers must contain only the decoy name using a prefix prepended to their corresponding target protein accessions.

A `decoy.sh` script is provided for easily generating a target and a decoy database using the same criteria we used in the paper. In the target database isoleucines are replaced with leucines, and the decoy database is generated using `decoyPYrat`.

```
Usage:

  ./decoy.sh input.fasta decoy_prefix

  Where:
    input.fasta : input fasta file with target sequences using UniProt headers
    decoy_prefix: prefix to be used for decoy names

  Outputs:
    target.fasta: output target fasta file replacing isoleucines in input.fasta
    decoy.fasta : output decoy fasta file generated with decoyPYrat
```

## Gene-level scores and FDR

A `run.sh` script is provided for easily running all the gene-level scores and FDRs combinations presented in the paper using the fasta target/decoy databases and the search engine output files provided by the user.

It is important to use the target/decoy fasta headers formatting explained in the previous section. You can use the ones generated by `decoy.sh`.

```
Usage:

  ./run.sh target.fasta decoy.fasta decoy_prefix target_dir decoy_dir output_dir

  Where:
    target.fasta: fasta file with target sequences using UniProt headers
    decoy.fasta : fasta file with decoy sequences which headers consists ONLY
                  in a decoy prefix prepended to the target protein accession
    decoy_prefix: prefix used for decoy names
    target_dir  : directory with output files using a separated target database search
    decoy_dir   : directory with output files using a separated decoy database search
    output_dir  : directory for saving the results after executing this workflow
```
